Changelog
LuaWebGen

v1.3 (2021-05-24)
- Added JSON as a supported data format.
- Added "xml" as a new template file type (for e.g. RSS feeds and sitemaps).
- Added commands 'new feed' and 'new sitemap'.
- Added site.description .
- Added page.description and page.dateModified .
- Added global 'utf8' module.
- Added global 'scripts' object (similar to 'data').
- Added functions: summarize(), getGeneratedPages(), echoSmart(), isValueHtml(), clampArray(), gmatchAndBetween(), json.parse(), toml.parse().
- Added --date option for specifying the date to build for.
- subpages() can now take a path prefix as an argument.
- Trying to access page.content too early or in an invalid situation will now raise an error.
- Improved some error messages.
- Fixed subpages() including pages in sibling folders whose name begins with the same name (e.g. '/blog/index.md' included pages under '/blogosphere/').
- XML module: All functions now work both on the library object and as methods on elements.
- XML module: Added functions: xml.contentsToXml(), xml.contentsToHtml(), xml.getHtmlText().
- XML module: xml.walk() now supports traversal actions by returning a value from the callback.

v1.2 (2021-05-18)
- Added config.dataTextParsers and config.dataBinaryParsers for defining custom data file parsers.
- Added getDataTextParsers() and getDataBinaryParsers().
- Added new XML/HTML parsing module (available through the global object 'xml') to replace the now-removed Penlight+LuaExpat dependency. (The Penlight API still works.)
- Fixed --autobuild stopping the program if there was an error during the build.
- The scripts folder can new have subfolders (just like the data folder).
- Fixed the context being wrong sometimes.
- All errors now (at least) log the traceback.
- Improved some parsing error messages.
- Rewrote/simplified the internal error handling system.
- Apache/htaccess: Error documents pointing to files are validated at the end of builds.

v1.1 (2021-05-06)
- Added variant of generateFromTemplate() that takes a page initializer callback function.
- Added printObject().
- Line endings in read text files are normalized.
- Better XML parsing in Windows version. (CDATA sections now work.) (Universal version users should install LuaExpat.)
- Improved parsing of {{url}} blocks.
- Fixed Markdown parsing issue for links using angle brackets: [text](<url>)
- Removed usage of the <base> tag from new sites and pages.

v1.0 (2021-05-01)
Embedded code:
- Whitespace around code blocks can be trimmed away with '{{*' and '*}}'.
- Code block parsing is a lot more robust (e.g. '{{fori {8,4,11}}}' now works).
- Code blocks like '{{--foo}}' are no longer valid as '}}' is now part of the Lua comment.
- Added '{{for < n}}' and '{{fori < arr}}' for iterating backwards.
- Removed '{{for -n}}' (which used to iterate backwards).
- Fixed '{{some-url-here}}' not working with absolute URLs.
API:
- Added config.redirectionLayout for customizing redirection pages.
- Added config.ignorePaths .
- Added getOutputtedFiles().
- generateFromTemplate() can now take page parameters as an argument. (This reduces the need for formatTemplate().)
- Pages can use no layout by setting page.layout to an empty string.
- The check for whether '{{expression}}' results in HTML or text is now stricter (i.e. resulting in text more often).
- config.ignoreFiles and config.ignoreFolders no longer match things in the 'data' folder.
- Removed 'isAny(valueToCompare,arrayOfValues)' variant. Calls need to be changed into 'isAny(valueToCompare,unpack(arrayOfValues))'.
- Redirection functionality is more robust.
- Updated generated HTML for redirection pages.
- Renamed _WEBGEN_VERSION to WEBGEN_VERSION.
- Fixed simplified 'for' loop only accepting numerals. It now accepts any value expression.
- Fixed accessing valid globals in the main chunk in config.lua resulting in context error.
- Fixed page properties being writable in layouts.
- Fixed line numbers being wrong in some error messages.
- Fixed possibility for internally generated Lua code to break because of function name shadowing.
- Smaller bug fixes.

v0.20 (2021-04-22)
- First "proper" release.
- Small fixes.

v0.19 (2018)
- Initial beta release.
